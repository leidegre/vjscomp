vjscomp is wrapper around the Google Closure Compiler

vjscomp rewrites warnings and error messages from the compiler
into a format that's understood by Visual Studio

See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yxkt8b26.aspx for details about this format

vjscomp forwards the command line to the default command line runner
and does not modify the compiler in any other way

For your convenience the wrapper has been pre-packaged in vjscomp.jar

You still need to obtain Google Closure Compiler archive and put that in 
the same directory as vjscomp but other than that you invoke vjscomp exactly
as you would invoke the Google Closure Compiler from the command line

i.e.

    java -jar vjscomp.jar --js input.js

You don't have to specify `compiler.jar` as it's already in the manifest classpath
and will get picked up automatically

If you encouter any problems, make sure the `compiler.jar` and `vjscomp.jar` 
exists in the same directory
